    <h1> UCA Data Visualizations 2016 - 2017 </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
        The following data visualizatons were created by the UCA Student Life Office using the D3 Javascript library.
    </p>

    <h3>  <a href= 'd3/dash.html'> Demographic Dashboard</a> </h3>
    <p>
        Basic demographic dashboard of students broken down by countries, majors, gender, rural-urban.
    </p>


    <h3> <a href = 'd3/sankey.html'> Intended Majors </a> </h3>
    <p>
        This diagram charts the migration of first-year students between majors from time of admissions to midyear.  Additional data on choice of majors was scheduled to be collected after the Connecting with Your Disciplines Program.  Because the deadline for student selection of majors was moved to August 1, this data is not available at the time of publication.
    </p>

    <h3> <a href = 'd3/net.html'> Network Graph </a></h3>
    <p>
        This network graph depicts the social network of our students before they were admitted to UCA.  Each student is depicted as a dot and those who knew each other are linked by a solid line.  The user of this visualization can move dots to get an idea of how many relationships each student had as well as a better visual indication of how the network is structured.<br><br>

        This visualization show us that students from Khorog had the most developed and intricate social network, but that is expected due to the geography and size of the community and its familiarity with UCA.  However, there is a significant subset of students of students from different countries and locations who formed a fairly well-developed social network before application.  The common thread that links these students is their participation in summer camp.  Conversely, there is a large population of Kyrgyz students who have few linkages and are not part of a distinct social network.  <br><br>

        It is interesting to note that even though our current campus is in Naryn, the majority of students enrolled in the first year are from Tajikistan, particularly Khorog, because they are linked to networks and people connected to UCA. This suggests that programs like summer camp or winter upgrading play a valuable role in enhancing application numbers and enrollment and that students who are interconnected are more likely to attend UCA than those outside of a network. It is thus essential for UCA to create as many opportunities as possible for prospective students to become linked with other students interested in UCA, as well as with multiple UCA representatives and resources.

    <h3> <a href = 'final_corr.png'> Correlation Matrix</a></h3>
    <p>
        This correlation matrix shows the relationship between 2016 admissions test scores and first semester academic performance of students. <br /> <br />

        In order to read this chart, follow the intersection of the independent variables (in red, in the center of the chart) to find their correlation coefficient. For example, in the lower right hand corner, the correlation between Math_grade and Sci_grade is 0.67.
